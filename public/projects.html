            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>
               A hospital triage system that allows patients to check in and be added to a waitlist. The system also
               allows hospital staff to view the waitlist and update the status of patients. The system is built using
               HTML,
               CSS, React.js, and node.js. The system also features a MySQL database to store patient information.

            <h3>Design of the System</h3>
            <p>The design of the system can be grouped into the following components:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>UI
                  <ul>
                     <li>Design of the login screen</li>
                     <li>Design of the Patient Screen</li>
                     <li>Design of the Admin Screen</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>JavaScript and logic
                  <ul>
                     <li>Logging in</li>
                     <li>Viewing Patient Data</li>
                     <li>Admitting a Patient</li>
                     <li>Adding a new Patient</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>UI</h3>
            <b>Design of the login screen</b>
            <p>The Login component is a React functional component that manages the login process for two types of users: patients and
            administrators. It uses the useState hook to manage the state of the currently selected user type (loginUser), which can
            be either "Patient" or "Admin," and to handle any error messages during the login process.

            The component starts by defining constants for the user types (PATIENT and ADMIN) and then initializes state variables
            for the loginUser and any error messages. The changeLoginUserHandler function toggles the loginUser state between
            "Patient" and "Admin."

            The component contains two separate asynchronous functions, patientSubmitHandler and adminSubmitHandler, which handle
            the form submission for patients and administrators, respectively. These functions make POST requests to the appropriate
            endpoints (/patient/login for patients and /admin/login for administrators) and handle the response. If the login is
            successful, the user state and data are updated through props passed to the component; if there is an error, an error
            message is displayed.

            The form layout changes dynamically based on the current loginUser. For patients, the form asks for a name and a
            3-letter code, while for administrators, it asks for a username and a password. Both forms include validation to ensure
            required fields are filled out, and they display an error message if the login fails.

            The UI of the component is styled with a CSS module (Login.css). The form is contained within a form-container section
            that has a dark blue background, rounded corners, and a box shadow for a modern look. The form elements are styled to be
            responsive and user-friendly, with a focus on accessibility. The submit button changes color on hover, and an error
            state is visually indicated by changing the button's color to red. Additionally, there is a button to switch between the
            patient and admin login forms, enhancing user experience by allowing easy toggling between the two login modes.</p>
            <br>
            <b>Design of the Patient Screen</b>
            <p>The Patient component is a simple React functional component designed to display personalized information for a
            logged-in patient. It imports its styles from a CSS file named Patient.css. The component receives patient data through
            props, specifically accessing the first element in the patientData array to obtain relevant details. It extracts the
            first name of the patient from the patient_name field for a personalized greeting and displays the patient's wait time.

            The component includes a logoutHandler function, which, when invoked by clicking the "Log Out" button, updates the user
            state to "SignedOut" through a prop function, effectively logging the user out.

            The UI is styled for a clean and user-friendly appearance. The main container (patient-container) has a dark blue
            background, rounded corners, and a subtle box shadow to create a card-like appearance. The text elements, including the
            greeting and wait time information, are centered for readability, with the wait time emphasized using a bold font. The
            "Log Out" button includes a hover effect that reduces its opacity, providing visual feedback to the user. The overall
            design ensures that the component is visually appealing and easy to interact with, enhancing the patient’s user
            experience.</p>
            <br>
            <b>Design of the Admin Screen</b>
            <p>The Admin component is a comprehensive React functional component designed to facilitate the administration of patient
            data. It utilizes several hooks, including useState, useEffect, and useCallback, to manage the component’s state and
            lifecycle events. The component maintains local states for controlling the visibility of a modal (showModal), enabling
            the submission button (enableSubmit), and storing input values for patient details (patientName, patientCode, severity).

            Upon mounting, the component fetches the latest patient data from the server using the updatePatientData function, which
            is defined using useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders. This function is called inside a useEffect hook to
            ensure the data is fetched when the component mounts and whenever the updatePatientData function changes. Another
            useEffect hook monitors the input states and enables the submit button only when all fields are filled out.

            The component renders a list of patient data, displaying details such as name, code, severity, and wait time. Each list
            item includes an "Admit" button that sends a PATCH request to update the patient's status and refreshes the data. The
            component also includes a logout button that clears the admin username from local storage and changes the user state to
            "SignedOut."

            A modal is used to add new patients, which is toggled by a button. The modal contains a form with inputs for patient
            name, code, and severity. The form submission handler (addPatientHandler) sends a POST request to the server to add a
            new patient and refreshes the patient data upon successful submission. The form submission button is disabled unless all
            fields are correctly filled, ensuring data integrity.

            The styling of the component, managed through an external CSS file (Admin.css), ensures a user-friendly and visually
            appealing interface. The main container has a dark blue background, rounded corners, and a box shadow to create a
            card-like effect. The patient list is displayed with a flexible layout, and each patient item has a distinct background
            color for readability. Buttons are styled with hover effects to enhance interactivity, and the modal overlays the entire
            screen with a semi-transparent background, focusing the user’s attention on the form.

            Overall, the Admin component is designed to provide a robust and efficient interface for managing patient data, with a
            focus on usability, data integrity, and visual appeal.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>JavaScript and Logic</h3>
            <br>
            <b>Logging in</b>
            <p>The login functionality is implemented in both the frontend and backend, facilitating the authentication of patients and
            administrators. On the frontend, the Login component handles user input and sends a POST request to the server with the
            login credentials. For patients, the endpoint /patient/login is used, whereas for admins, the endpoint /admin/login is
            targeted. The backend, defined in admin.js and patient.js, receives these requests and utilizes service functions
            (getAdmin and getPatient) to query the database for matching credentials. If a match is found, the server responds with
            the user data; otherwise, it returns an error message. The database query logic is handled using MySQL queries, ensuring
            secure and efficient data retrieval.</p>
            <br>
            <b>Viewing Patient Data</b>
            <p>In the Admin component, patient data is fetched and displayed. The frontend makes an asynchronous GET request to the
            /patient/all endpoint to retrieve all patient data that has not been admitted yet. This request is handled by the
            backend in patient.js, which calls the getAllPatientData service function. This function executes a complex SQL query
            that joins multiple tables (patients, triage_records, and administrators) to fetch comprehensive patient information,
            including their wait times and severity levels. The fetched data is then sent back to the frontend, where it is rendered
            in a list format for the admin to view.</p>
            <br>
            <b>Admitting a Patient</b>
            <p>When an admin admits a patient, the Admin component triggers the admitHandler function, which sends a PATCH request to
            the /patient/admit endpoint with the patient's ID. The backend route in patient.js calls the admitPatient service
            function, which updates the patient's status in the database to indicate they have been admitted. The function also
            adjusts the wait times of other patients to reflect the change in queue dynamics. The SQL queries handle updating the
            admitted status and decrementing the wait times of other patients appropriately, ensuring the queue remains accurate and
            fair.</p>
            <br>
            <b>Adding a new Patient</b>
            <p>Adding a new patient involves displaying a modal form in the Admin component, where the admin inputs the patient's name,
            code, and severity level. The form submission triggers the addPatientHandler function, which sends a POST request to the
            /patient/add endpoint. The backend handles this request in patient.js by calling the addPatient service function. This
            function inserts the new patient into the patients table and associates them with a triage record, calculating their
            wait time based on the severity and existing queue. The wait time calculation ensures that more severe cases are
            prioritized appropriately. The database operations involve multiple steps, including inserting records and updating wait
            times, ensuring the new patient is integrated seamlessly into the system.</p>

            <p>The rules of this tic tac toe game are simple. The user is presented with an empty 3 by 3 grid. The user
               will click on a
               cell in a grid to place an "X", attempting to get 3 cells with an "X" to match (horizontally, vertically,
               diagonally).
               Each time the user places an "X", the computer opponent will place an "O", also trying to get 3 in a row.
               Whoever gets 3
               in a row first wins. If neither the player or computer opponent gets 3 in a row, the round is a draw.
               Winning a round
               gets you a point.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>Design of the System</h3>
            <p>The design of the system can be grouped into the following components:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>UI
                  <ul>
                     <li>Design of the header</li>
                     <li>Design of the grid</li>
                     <li>Design of the scoreboard</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>JavaScript and logic
                  <ul>
                     <li>Filling in a cell</li>
                     <li>Computer turn</li>
                     <li>Checking for winner</li>

                     <li>Reset</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>UI</h3>
            <b>Design of the main container</b>
            <p>The main container is made of a main element. It uses CSS grid to orient the layout to allow the
               subcomponents to situate themselves inside.</p>
            <ul>
               <li><b>display: grid</b>: This makes the element a grid container, enabling the use of CSS Grid Layout
                  for its child elements.</li>
               <li><b>grid-template-columns repeat(3, 170px)</b>: This defines three columns in the grid, each 170
                  pixels wide.</li>
               <li><b>grid-template-rows 45px repeat(3, 170px) 80px</b>: This defines the rows in the grid. The first
                  row is 45 pixels tall, followed by three rows each 170 pixels tall, and a final row 80 pixels tall.
               </li>
               <li><b>row-gap 20px</b>: This sets a 20-pixel gap between each row in the grid.</li>
               <li><b>column-gap 20px</b>: This sets a 20-pixel gap between each column in the grid.</li>
               <li><b>align-items stretch</b>: This makes the items within the grid stretch to fill the entire height of
                  their grid area.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <b>Design of the header</b>
            <p>The header is made of 3 parts:</p>
            <ul>
               <li><b>Logo</b>
                  <ul>
                     <li>An img element that has a src property of the logo svg file</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li><b>Turn indicator</b>
                  <ul>
                     <li>A div that has an img for the icon corresponding to the current turn, and a span containing the
                        text "turn"</li>
                     <li>JavaScript is used to update the src property of the img to either an "x" or "o" depending on
                        whos turn it is</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li><b>Reset button</b>
                  <ul>
                     <li>A button with an img inside of it that is an svg icon</li>
                     <li>Has an event listener for click events to reset the grid</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <b>Design of the grid</b>
            <p>The grid is nothing more than a series of divs. Due to the nature of the grid layout of the parent
               element, the main container, the cells naturally form a grid. Each cell in the grid has a border bottom
               property to display a shadow like appearance for a more 3d effect. Each cell in the grid can have a css
               class that will add an "x" or "o" icon as well as disable pointer events.</p>

            <br>
            <b>Design of the scoreboard</b>
            <p>The scoreboard consists of 3 divs, each with their own color to make them distinctly represent the
               different score counts. Each div has a child span whos text is updated to display the score.</p>

            <br>
            <b>Design of the banner</b>
            <p>The banner, also known as the game result container, displays the result of the game. The
               <b>toggleGameResult</b> function in <b>tic-tac-toes.mjs</b> gets called to then toggle classes on the
               elemnts representing the game result banner. These css classes cuase an animation occurr to bring the
               game result banner into view.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>JavaScript and Logic</h3>

            <b>Filling in a cell</b>
            <p>When a player fills in a cell, they do so by triggering a click event on any one of the cells in the
               grid. One of two thing can happen:</p>
            <ul>
               <li><b>The cell is occupied</b>, meaning it has either an x or o in it
                  <ul>
                     <li>In this case, the css property "pointer-events" will be set to "none", disallowing the user to
                        trigger a click event on the cell</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li><b>The cell is empty</b>
                  <ul>
                     <li>In this case, the cell has the css class added to either display an "x" or "o" (depending on
                        the player's turn)</li>
                     <li>A count of the number of total filled cells in the grid is incremented</li>
                     <li>A count of the player's filled cells on the current row and column is incremented</li>
                     <li>Each player, both the user --and the cpu have an array "rows" and "columns" where rows[i] and
                        columns[i] represent the number of "x"s and "o"s, respectively (0 <= i <=3)</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of these pieces of information will be used to determine the game result.</p>
            <br>
            <b>Computer turn</b>
            <ul>
               <li>After the player fills in a cell and has their turn, the entire program waits 1.5 seconds (using
                  async/await) to simulate the computer thinking.</li>
               <li>The computer then fills in a cell with the exact same mechanism as the user filling a cell.</li>
               <li>During the computer's turn, pointer events on the grid are disabled for the user.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <b>Checking for game result</b>
            <p>The game can either end in the user winning, the computer winning, or the round ending in a draw:</p>
            <ul>
               <li><b>User winning:</b>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Each time the user places a cell, the number of filled cells across the current row, the
                        current column, and both diagonals are checked to see if they equal 3 (which then indicates 3 in
                        a row).</li>
                     <li>If it does equal 3, the winning cells are highlighted and then the win banner appears.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li><b>Computer winning:</b>
                  <ul>
                     <li>The mechanism is the same as the user winning.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li><b>Draw:</b>
                  <ul>
                     <li>When a draw occurs, the variable that keeps track of the number of filled cells is found to be
                        equal to the total number of cells.</li>
                     <li>In this case, it is then known that all cells are full and no 3 in a row has been found.</li>
                     <li>The draw banner appears.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <b>Scoreboard</b>
            <ul>
               <li>The scoreboard has 3 variables: The player score, the number of ties, and the computer score.</li>
               <li>These values are incremented depending on the game result.</li>
               <li>By using the local storage, the game scores can be stored on the local machine to be able to persist
                  between different sessions of running the application.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <b>Reset</b>
            <ul>
               <li>The game reset feature is used to clear the board and reset all variables to their default initial
                  values.</li>
               <li>This includes:
                  <ul>
                     <li>Removing all classes from the cells that pertain to the filled in symbol (x or o).</li>
                     <li>Setting the number of filled in cells to 0.</li>
                     <li>Setting the number of filled in player cells and computer cells across all rows and columns to
                        0.</li>
                     <li>Setting the player score, number of ties, computer score to 0 (and subsequently the
                        corresponding local storage values to 0).</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>

            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>
               This project is a trivia quiz application that allows users to test their knowledge on a variety of
               topics.
               The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application also features a timer that
               counts
               down as the user answers questions. The application also features a score counter that keeps track of the
               user's score as they answer questions. The application also features a results page that displays the
               user's
               final score and allows them to restart the quiz.
